## Welcome! 👋🏾

Hi I'm Kimberly a Prinicpal Level Data Scientist / Informaticist, Chemist, Health Disparities Researcher, and passionate Data Educator living in the Metro DC area. 

## My Career and What I Do
In my career journey, I have had a number of roles, including Bench Research Scientist, Lab Director, Health Data Analyst, and now Prinicpal Informaticist / Health Data Scientist.

This past summer, I was awarded an Internship in Health Informatics at Rutgers University, to study castration resistant prostate cancer in the research group of Dr. Antonia Mitrofanova. Project title: Novel computational algorithms to predict synergistic drug combinations for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

## Academic Pursuits 🎓

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Healthcare Informatics at Rutgers University and will finish my PhD in December 2024. My dissertation is not just research; it's a personal mission to use AI/Machine Learning to improve the health outcomes of Black women living with HIV, reflecting my commitment to real-time solutions for health disparities. I also have a strong interst in artifical intelligence / machine learning applications in the fields of cheminformatics and computational toxicology.

## Advocacy and Outreach

Understanding and being a beneficiary of the power of community and representation, I'm the Executive Director of BlackTIDES Data where I serve as the Informatics Lead. BlackTIDES Data aims to connect with, teach, and mentor current and future Black Data professionals to thrive in the fields of Technology, Informatics, Data Science, Epidemiology, and the Social Sciences. I also curate a newslwetter in Healthcare Data Science, Health Disparities, and Computational Biology where I share my insights, latest research findings, and analysis using the latest data analytics tools to foster a deeper understanding among professionals and enthusiasts alike. Through these platforms, I am committed to uplifting and expanding the representation of Black professionals in STEM fields, ensuring they have the network and knowledge to excel and thrive.
